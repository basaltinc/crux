## Primary Logo

<div class="text-content">
Basalt’s primary logo incorporates the icon into the wordmark creating a clean and boldly affective brand identity. The use of all caps brings a modern sense of strength and stability. The icon represents an abstracted and geometric tent but also mimics the structure of basalt columns bringing the overall tone back to the natural world and creating a playful sense of adventure.

This is the main logo that will be used across all primary brand applications and platforms. It is the main touch point for your audience to identity Basalts product, web presence, social media, ads, and other brand materials. It is imperative that the logo always be applied with consideration and accordance to the brand guidelines to maximize the success of Basalts brand presence.

### Minimum Size

The smallest the Basalt logo should be presented is 1.5 inches wide, when representing the logo on a scale below 1.5 inches, it is best to use the icon only.

## Construction

The Basalt logo has been constructed with care, to ensure that it is always legible in context it is important to maintain the minimum “clear space”. This space isolates the logo from any potentially competing graphic elements or margins that may conflict with the impact of the logo.

The clear space is equal to the width of the ‘B’ to preserve proportions.

## Color Treatment

<div class="text-content">
The color usage within the Basalt logo is minimal and will always appear as black or white and often will include a pop of color against neutral tones

### Tips

* Use contrasting colors (white text on dark tones/ black text on light tones)
* Use solid logo marks on colored backgrounds to minimize competition
* When placing logomarks on photographic back- grounds refer to the photo guidelines.

Exercise care when placing the logo mark over photographic backgrounds. It’s important to ensure that the logomark does not compete with elements in the photo and always remains legible. In most cases either a solid white or solid black logo on top of a background image will work.

### Tips

* Avoid busy images with lots of detail
* When working with high contrast images, turn down the opacity for better legibility
* Apply overlays when appropriate
* Photos with a shallow depth-of-field work well

## Photo Overlays

Photo Overlays can be used to add variety within graphic elements when appropriate but a few rules apply when adding an overlay to a photographic background.

### Tips

* Overlays should come all the way to at least 1 edge
* Overlays should be placed at 80%–50% opacity
* Overlays work best when either text or graphic elements are placed within them.

Ensure overlays do not obstruct or conflict with elements in the photo.
